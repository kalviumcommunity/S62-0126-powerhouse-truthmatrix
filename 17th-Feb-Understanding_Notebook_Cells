# Milestone: Code and Markdown Structure

This notebook demonstrates the correct use of Code and Markdown cells.
It focuses on separating computation from explanation and maintaining
a clean, professional notebook structure.

## Purpose of This Notebook

This notebook demonstrates:

- Creating and executing Code cells
- Creating and rendering Markdown cells
- Separating logic from explanation
- Structuring notebooks clearly and professionally

In professional Data Science workflows:

- Code shows what was done
- Markdown explains why it was done and what it means

```
# Simple arithmetic example

a = 10
b = 5
sum_result = a + b

sum_result
```

## Explanation of the Arithmetic Example

In the previous Code cell:

- Two variables (`a` and `b`) were created.
- They were added together.
- The result was stored in `sum_result`.
- The final value was displayed as output.

This demonstrates how Code cells perform computation.

```
# List comprehension example

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = [n**2 for n in numbers]

squared_numbers
```

## Explanation of the List Example

In the previous Code cell:

- A list of numbers was created.
- A list comprehension was used to square each number.
- A new list containing squared values was generated.

This shows how Code cells execute logic, while Markdown cells explain the reasoning.

## Understanding Cell Types

There are two primary cell types used in this notebook:

### Code Cells
- Used for writing and executing Python code
- Perform computations
- Produce outputs

### Markdown Cells
- Used for explanation and documentation
- Structure the notebook
- Provide reasoning and interpretation

Separating Code and Markdown ensures that notebooks are readable,
maintainable, and aligned with professional Data Science practices.

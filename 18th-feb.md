# Running, Restarting, and Interrupting Jupyter Kernels

## Objective
This notebook demonstrates safe and intentional control of the Jupyter kernel,
including execution order awareness, interrupting running cells, and restarting
the kernel to reset state.

## Demonstrations Included
- Running cells sequentially and observing kernel state
- Interrupting a long-running execution safely
- Restarting the kernel to clear memory
- Rerunning cells from the top after restart

## Why This Matters
Improper kernel management can lead to hidden state bugs, execution order issues,
and non-reproducible notebooks. This milestone ensures clean and predictable
notebook behavior.

## Notes
- No datasets or analysis were used
- Examples were kept intentionally simple
- Kernel was restarted and rerun before verification

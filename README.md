# Part A: README Documentation (PR Submission)

## 1. Explaining the Lifecycle
The Question -> Data -> Insight lifecycle starts by asking a clear, specific question because it determines what you measure, what you ignore, and what counts as a useful answer. A vague question leads to vague data collection and results you cannot act on. A precise question defines the scope, the decision you want to make, and the criteria for success or change.

Data is the evidence for that question, not just a pile of numbers. Understanding the data means knowing where it came from, what each field represents, how it was collected, and what biases or gaps it might contain. If you do not understand the data, you can easily analyze the wrong signal or misread what the evidence is actually saying.

Insights are not just output from a tool; they emerge from exploring the data in the context of the question. Exploration helps you notice patterns, exceptions, and relationships that answer the question in a way that is meaningful for action. The connection is linear: the question shapes the data you need, and the data shapes the insights you can responsibly claim.

## 2. Applying the Lifecycle to a Project Context
**Project context:** A local grocery chain wants to reduce food waste without hurting customer satisfaction.

- **Question:** Which products and time windows contribute most to unsold inventory, and what changes could reduce waste while keeping shelves stocked?
- **Data needed:** Point-of-sale transactions, inventory levels, product expiration dates, and delivery schedules. This data could come from the store's POS system and inventory management system, and it represents what was sold, what was stocked, and what expired by product and location.
- **Useful insight:** A ranked list of high-waste items by store and day, plus evidence that adjusting order quantities or delivery timing for those items would reduce waste without increasing out-of-stock events. This is actionable for managers planning weekly orders.

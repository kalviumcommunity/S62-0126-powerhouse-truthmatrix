**Multimodal Fake Content Detection Using Data Science and Machine Learning**

*Project Overview*

This project aims to build an automated system for detecting fake content using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes both textual news articles and manipulated images to identify misinformation effectively.

The project combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text analysis and Computer Vision techniques for image analysis to create a multimodal fake content detection system.

*Problem Statement*

Fake content in the form of misleading news articles and manipulated or AI-generated images is becoming increasingly difficult to identify. Manual verification methods are slow and not scalable.

This project focuses on developing an automated system that can:

    Analyze textual news content

    Detect misleading or fake information

    Identify manipulated or AI-generated images

    Provide accurate, data-driven predictions
